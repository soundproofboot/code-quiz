This project is designed to test the user's understanding of Javascript fundamentals and compare their level of understanding to other users. The user is asked a series of questions on the fundamentals of Javascript. They have 60 seconds to answer all the questions, and any questions answered incorrectly will cost the user 10 seconds. When the user finishes, if they have time left they're asked for their initials, which are saved. 

## Credits

This concept was inspired by a project for the U of M coding bootcamp.
